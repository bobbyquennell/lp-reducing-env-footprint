              Gharam and her family are from Aleppo. Her favourite colours are red and yellow and she dreams of becoming a doctor. When asked about The Peace Play Project, she said "I love it, A LOT". This is the only place for her to play safely and make friends. Gharam gets very excited for every session.

            <p class="item-content-details align-left">Leena's family fled Syria with only the clothes they were wearing. She has been in camp for five years now. It's crowded and the streets are too dangerous to play outside. The peace Play Project is the only time Leena gets to play with other children outside of ther family and become the outgoing little girl she is.</p>

We provide a safe space for them to play and finally be children again. This Christmas, we are thrilled to be partnering with The Body Shop. Every gift you buy from The Body Shop's seasonal gift collections will help a Syrian child smile again. What a great way to share the spirit of Christmas."
